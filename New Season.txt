I am a new me because the old is gone and
behold the new has come
The same God that knows the 
exact numbers of hair on my head
Is the same God that will see me through
this course, expand my territories to greater
horizons, have a startup that will be for
God and about God 
The product I don't know
What I do know is that I want
to have a product for God.

Jesus take the wheel
