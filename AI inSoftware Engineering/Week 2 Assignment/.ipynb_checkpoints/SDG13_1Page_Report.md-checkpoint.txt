# SDG 13 — Machine Learning for Climate Action 🌍

### 🧩 Problem
Rising CO₂ emissions threaten sustainable development and environmental stability.  
Understanding future emission patterns helps decision-makers act early.  
This project applies **AI for sustainability** to forecast CO₂ emissions per capita for each country.

### 🧠 Approach
Using **Supervised Learning (Regression)** and a **Neural Network (PyTorch)**, the model predicts future CO₂ emissions per capita from:
- Year  
- Region (encoded numerically)  
- Total CO₂ emissions (Kilotons)

### 📊 Dataset
Dataset: *Carbon_(CO2)_Emissions_by_Country.csv*  
Source: Open World Bank/Kaggle data  
Size: Global data by country and year  
Preprocessing: Extracted year, handled missing values, and encoded regions.

### ⚙️ Results
The model achieved:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** ~0.15  
- **R² Score:** ~0.88  

Visual inspection showed predictions aligned closely with actual emissions.

### 🌱 Ethical & Social Reflection
- **Bias:** Developed nations have more consistent data, which could affect fairness.
- **Sustainability:** Helps direct policy and renewable incentives where emissions are growing.
- **Fair Use:** Designed for insight, not enforcement—promotes transparency and open access.

### 🚀 Impact
Supports **UN SDG 13: Climate Action** by showing how machine learning can drive data-informed sustainability decisions.

The dataset used has gaps for some countries, which may cause the model to predict less accurately for those regions.
To make it fair, CO₂ data was normalized per person, not by total output.
This ensures countries of different sizes are compared equally.

The project supports SDG 13 – Climate Action by helping leaders use data to plan better and act early.
It promotes sustainable decision-making while keeping the AI process transparent and open-source.
